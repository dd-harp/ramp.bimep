## $\odot$

We need to develop a way of sub-dividing the island into contiguous areas that will all be assigned an optimal strategy. The areas can differ in size, but they would be *homogeneous* with respect to malaria transmission and the needs for malaria control operations.  

+ Operational

    - The areas have similar prospects for successful spraying with IRS
    
    - The areas have similar prospects for successful LSM 
    
    - The areas have similar prospects for high coverage with LLINs 

+ Transmission & Connectivity

    - The areas have a similar *Pf*PR
    
    - The areas have a similar travel prevalence 
    
    - The areas have a similar drug taking  
    
+ Geography

    - The areas are close together
    
    - The population densities are *similar*
